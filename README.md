# Installation
## Prerequisites
We assume the user's system is set up with the following. See attached links for guidance if not.
1. A Linux-like environment: tested on Ubuntu 22.04 and Windows Subsystems Linux (WSL2) Ubuntu 22.04. User experience with Windows/Mac will vary.
1. Conda (for managing packages). See https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/linux.html
1. Python > 3.7 <= 3.12 (developed for 3.10), ideally installed specifically to a Conda environment made for running Castanet.
1. Java runtime environment (for running external dependency, Trimmomatic). See https://www.java.com/en/download/manual.jsp

## Environment setup
We strongly recommend creating a new Conda environment for your Castanet install:
```$conda create --name castanet python==3.10```
Which can be activated with:
```$conda activate castanet```
Before installing your pip libraries:
```$pip install -r requirements.txt```
Then the software dependencies:
```$sudo . install_deps.sh```

## Prerequisite files
Users may provide the following data to use Castanet:
1. Paired read sequence files located in their own folder. Castanet infers file names from a supplied folder ("ExpDir") and sequence name ("SeqName"), meaning that all input file names need to be standardised. The trailing portion of each read should end in "_1"/"_2" and the input parameter "SeqName" should reference the file names minus these suffixes. E.g. Read files: "data/mydata_1.fastq.gz", "data/mydata_2.fastq.gz" should be provided, with SeqName specified as "mydata" and ExpDir "data/".
1. A collection of fasta sequences that comprise the user's probe set, with a naming convention compatible with Castanet (see section "Supported probe formats")
1. (Optional) A CSV file describing the total number of reads from your original, unedited input files. Columns should include: "sampleid" (i.e. mysample_1...), "pt" to link to clinical data (if present, otherwise leave blank) and "rawreadnum". If not present, Castanet will assume that your input fasta has not been filtered and hence, will infer the max n reads from these.
1. (Optional) A CSV file containing clinical metadata, which may be joined to output statistics via the "pt" key (see above).

All other pre-requisites can be generated by Castanet and associated automation scripts.

## Supported input probe formats

Castanet works by aggregating reads on target at the organism level, which is achieved through filtering probe names.

Ideally probe names will be in the format:

```>Genus-species_....```

E.g.:
```
>hbv_10407_cluster0
>treponema_pallidum_bact000001
>haemophilus_influenzae_bact000016_haemophilus-19_influenzae-16-parainfluenzae
```

Castanet can also process several standard formats (LOWER CASE TRANSFORMED):
1. ```bact[0-9]+_([A-Za-z]+)-[0-9]+[|_]([A-Za-z]+)```
1. ```bact[0-9]+_[0-9]+_([A-Za-z]+_[A-Za-z_]+)```
1. ```bact[0-9]+_([a-z]+_[a-z_]+)```

N.b. the inclusion of rMLST nomenclature is optional, as is its position in the header string.

Your probe panel will be unique to your experiments, hence we have not provided one. We do, however, provide a convenience endpoint in the API to help you convert a multifasta (or multiple fasta files) into a format that Castanet can interact with, in addition to an accompanying CSV file that measures the length of each. You may still need to modify your probe headers and/or the convenience function to ensure full compatibility, however.


## Example workflow, using API (recommended)
### Run commands
1. Install dependencies (see above)
1. Start an API server with ```uvicorn app.api:app --port 8000```
1. Visit API home page in your browser, using address ```http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs```
1. Expand green drop-down for end_to_end endpoint. Click "Try it out" button (top right of expanded green boxes). Copy-paste command string below (after amending the capitalised fields to fit your input data), trigger the function with "Execute" button. Details of output, including run information and errors, are shown in the terminal that was used to launch the API server. Output will be stored in ./experiments/{ExpName}.

```
{
  "ConsensusMinD": 10,
  "ConsensusCoverage": 30,
  "ConsensusMapQ": 1,
  "LineageFile": "data/ncbi_lineages_2023-06-15.csv.gz",

  "AdaptP": "data/all_adapters.fa",
  "ExpName": "MY_EXPERIMENT",
  "SeqName": "SEQUENCE_NAME",
  "ExpDir": "./data/FOLDER"
}
```

N.b. pay attention to your argument type: strings should be encased in double quotes, whereas numbers and booleans (true, false) don't need to be. Any arguments that default to empty ('"ArgName": ""') are optional and may be left blank

## Example workflow, using original script functionality
N.B. some optional parameters from the original scripts are hard-coded. Full and extended functionality is offered in the API.

### Run commands
1. Install prerequisites
1. Install dependencies with ```sudo bash install_deps.sh```
1. Call end-to-end script with ```python3 app/end_to_end_script.py -ExpDir data/ -SeqName mysample -RefStem myrefstem.fasta -PostFilt True -Samples data/samples.csv -Probes data/probes.csv```

# Container setup
An example dockerfile and build/run scripts are included for guidance only.

1. Install Docker ```https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/```
1. Build and run container ```bash build.sh && bash run.sh```

Users are encouraged to consult a system admin if they experience issues with building, accessing or deploying containers.

# Function descriptions
## Input arguments common to multiple functions
1. Experiment directory [ExpDir]. Folder where data is stored and may be saved.
1. Experiment name [ExpName]. Name used to prefix final output.
1. Sequence name [SeqName]. name common to your input sequences, without prefixes, suffixes or file extensions. N.b. we assume your data will have the following format: {ExpDir}{SeqName}_1.fasta.gz, {ExpDir}{SeqName}_2.fasta.gz.
1. Threads [NThreads]. Number of individual processes to be run concurrently.

## Preprocess
Calls Kraken2, which is a command line tool for doing taxonomic classification using exact k-mer matches, to identify human (genomic and mitochondrial) raw reads, as well as common contaminants. Output are called in the next pipeline step and removed prior to analysis. For more details, see ```https://ccb.jhu.edu/software/kraken2/```

*Input args*
1. Kraken database directory [KrakenDbDir] (set up automatically through running ```install_deps.sh```).

*Output*
1. {ExpDir}{SeqName}_1.kraken. Kraken2 output file.

## Filter keep reads
Calls Castanet FilterKeepReads class, which makes lists of reads from raw sequences, identified via Kraken2, that are to be retained or removed. There are user-specified options for expanding these rules, through comparison with an input file of lineages. Users may generate such a file, see below: Dependency notes > Lineage file. Final step is to do the filter and save the output to a compressed fastq file.

*Input args*
1. (Optional) Lineage file [LineageFile], in .csv or .gz format. N.b. user is expected to supply the directory and file extension.
1. (Optional) Exclude IDs [ExcludeIds]. NCBI TaxIDs from lineage file to exclude from analysis. Recommend to use default TaxID 9606 (human).
1. (Optional) Retain IDs [RetainIds]. NCBI TaxIDs from lineage file to retain in analysis.
1. (Optional) List of names to exclude [ExcludeNames]. Taxonomic names to exclude, which are searched for in the input lineage file and converted into TaxIDs. Must be a comma separated list with no spaces.
1. (Optional) List of names to retain [RetainNames]. Taxonomic names to retain, which are searched for in the input lineage file and converted into TaxIDs. Must be a comma separated list with no spaces.

*Output*
1. Filtered sequence files: {ExpDir}{SeqName}_[12]_filt.fastq

## Trim data
Uses Trimmomatic to remove low quality reads and sequencer adapters. We assume this tool will be installed as described in the automated installer script, in particular with regard to version and directory, as these are hard-coded in the call (in app/src/trim_adapters.py). Input files are filtered *_filt.fasta.gz from previous stage, and output are trimmed versions of the input in addition to separate (temp) files containing the trimmings.

*Input args*
1. Adapters file [AdaptP]: Path to .fa file containing adapter sequences. For convenience, we have included a file in the /data/ directory containing several commonly-used adapters, but the Trimmomatic tool will also download a number of individual files specific to sequencing technique in its root directory.

*Output*
1. Trimmed files: {ExpDir}{SeqName}_[12]_clean.fastq
1. Trimmings files: {ExpDir}{SeqName}_[12]_trimmings.fastq

## Map reads to reference
Uses BWA algorithm to map reads against reference sequences. Initial step is to index the reference .fasta file (not included!), after which mem function is used to map your cleaned input sequences against the indexed references. Samtools are then used to map the output to the shell, which are then sorted and saved as a compressed alignment map (*.bam) file.

*Input args*
1. Reference sequence file [RefStem]. Reference sequences in .fasta format. Include full file path and extension.

*Output*
1. Compressed alignment map file: {ExpDir}{SeqName}.bam

## Generate counts
Iterate over bam files in your experiment directory (N.b. this is a batching function! Ensure you know which files are present in this directory before using!), decrypt to SAM format and print to terminal; output are piped directly to Castanet parse_bam functions to produce a CSV file containing position counts. Parse BAM functions are multi functional - this entrypoint specifies to do only the "parse" functions, which generate counts for uniquely mapped sequences identified. Functions can differentiate between properly paired matches (with a suitably-long match length) and badly paired but sufficiently long sequence match.

*Input args*
(No non-generic input)

*Output*
1 CSV file containing counts: {ExpDir}PosCounts.csv

## Analysis

*Input args*
1. Probe lengths list [Probes]. CSV file containing list of probes and their respective lengths, with headers {target_id, target_len}. User must specify input folder and file extension.
1. Sample mapping file [Samples]. CSV file containing information about raw reads, with headers {sampleid,pt,rawreadnum}. Field "pt" must match clinical data, if specified.
1. (OPTIONAL) Clinical data file [Clin]. CSV contianing clinical details, which may be mapped to samples via Samples file pt field.
1. (OPTIONAL) Path to previously generated file containing read depts [DepthInf]. Used for regenerating full CSV of results with clinical info. Must contain headers {sampleid,
                        target_id, depth_mean, depth_std, depth_25pc,
                        depth_median, depth_75pc, prop_target_covered,
                        prop_target_covered_mindepth2,
                        prop_target_covered_mindepth5,
                        prop_target_covered_mindepth10, udepth_mean,
                        udepth_std, udepth_25pc, udepth_median, udepth_75pc,
                        uprop_target_covered, uprop_target_covered_mindepth2,
                        uprop_target_covered_mindepth5,
                        uprop_target_covered_mindepth10}.

*Output*
1. Directory of coverage plots: Depth_{ExpName}
1. Number and proportion of reads for each sample and reference: {ExpName}_depth.csv. (Positives may need to be calibrated against a reference set, but in general, the proportion of all clean reads that match the given target (clean_prop_of_reads_on_target) is a good place to start.)
1. File containing reads to drop for post filter removal of misassigned reads: {ExpName}_reads_to_drop.csv.

## Post filter
Output of analysis (misassigned reads) may be used to post (downstream) filter input BAM file. Uses Samtools to decode and parse contents of BAM file, which are piped to Casta parse_bam functions (ONLY filter functions).

*Input args*
(No non-generic input)

*Output*
1. Compressed alignment map file: {ExpDir}{SeqName}.bam

# Dependency notes
The included `install_deps.sh` script will attempt to install the following dependencies automatically. Depending on your specific system set-up, manual installation of some or all components may still be required. Details are included below.

## Lineage file
We have included a lineage file in the repo for convenience. Users may generate up-to-date files using the repository below.

``` https://github.com/zyxue/ncbitax2lin  ```

## Mapper
Mapping is an essential process to Castanet, which involves comparing our experiment reads with a number of pre-defined reference sequences. We opt for bwa-mem2 for doing Burrows Wheeler alignment.

```https://github.com/bwa-mem2/bwa-mem2```

Castanet is not tested with original bwa, bowtie2 etc., but may be compatible.

## Samtools
Samtools is a collection of software libraries that provides a range of functions for interrogating NGS data, specifically in Sequence Alignment Map (SAM) format and the compressed Binary- (BAM) format. These functions include reading, writing and viewing the contents of these files.

```http://www.htslib.org/```

## Trimmomatic
Trimming is an essential quality control process for removing sequence fragments that would contaminate our analyses. Specifically, we use Trimmomatic here to remove both low quality reads and our Illumina adapters (via MINLEN and ILLUMINACLIP functions).

```http://www.usadellab.org/cms/?page=trimmomatic```

## MAFFT
Generation of consensus sequences requires multiple sequence alignment. Castanet is developed for use with MAFFT as we find it to be faster/more scalable and more accurate other programs. It is not possible to substitute MAFFT for another MSA program without making code changes, as we use functionality for adding unaligned fragnentary sequences that, to our knowledge, is unique to MAFFT.

```https://mafft.cbrc.jp/alignment/software/```

## ViralConsensus
We use several algorithms to construct consensus sequences, one of which is Morishi's "ViralConsensus", which is a fast and memory-efficient tool for calling whole genome sequences directly from read aligned data. See Ref. `https://doi.org/10.1093/bioinformatics/btad317` for more information.
